# Check code size.
# We have a different hard limit for the candidate max code size in different host implementations
# however if the code size is acceptable we should have it put in some metric bucket

# check if we have at least 1 sample, but we should have many more.
alice: reports histogram polkadot_parachain_candidate_validation_code_size has at least 1 samples in buckets ["16384", "32768", "65536", "131072", "262144", "524288", "1048576", "2097152", "4194304", "8388608", "+Inf"] within 60 seconds

# Ensure parachains made progress.
# We have a different hard limit for the candidate max code size in different host implementations
# so we can't check for a specific value here. we only ensure that block production continued

alice: parachain 2000 block height is at least 10 within 200 seconds
