# Check authority status.
alice: reports node_roles is 4

# Ensure parachains are registered.
alice: parachain 2000 is registered within 60 seconds

# Ensure parachains made progress.
alice: parachain 2000 block height is at least 10 within 200 seconds

# Check execution time.
# There are two different timeout conditions: BACKING_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT(2s) and
# APPROVAL_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT(6s). Currently these are not differentiated by metrics
# because the metrics are defined in `polkadot-node-core-pvf` which is a level below
# the relevant subsystems.
# That being said, we will take the simplifying assumption of testing only the
# 2s timeout.

# We do this check by ensuring all executions fall into bucket le="2" or lower.
# First, check if we have at least 1 sample, but we should have many more.
alice: reports histogram polkadot_pvf_execution_time has at least 1 samples in buckets ["0.01", "0.025", "0.05", "0.1", "0.25", "0.5", "1", "2"] within 30 seconds

# Check if we have no samples > 2s.
alice: reports histogram polkadot_pvf_execution_time has 0 samples in buckets ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "8", "10", "12", "+Inf"] within 30 seconds
